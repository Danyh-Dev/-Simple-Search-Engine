# Simple Search Engine

## About This Project
This is a **Data Structures course project**. We developed a **simple search engine** capable of **indexing, retrieving, and ranking documents** based on user queries. The engine supports **Boolean queries (AND, OR)** and **term frequency (TF)** for ranking documents by relevance.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Used
- **Index:** Maps document IDs to the list of words in each document.  
- **Inverted Index:** Maps unique terms to the list of documents containing them.  
- **Inverted Index with BSTs:** Enhanced the inverted index using **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** for faster search.  
- **Lists:** Used for document collections, vocabulary, and term-document associations.  
- **BSTs:** Used to improve search efficiency, enabling logarithmic time lookups.

## What We Did
1. Built the **index** and **inverted index** using lists.  
2. Enhanced the **inverted index** using BSTs.  
3. Implemented **Boolean queries** (AND, OR) for document retrieval.  
4. Ranked documents using **term frequency (TF)**.  
5. Visualized and tested the search engine with sample queries.

   
## Team Work
This project was completed as a **team project**, and I was an active member of the team.
